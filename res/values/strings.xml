		Minesweeper is a single-player video game. The
		object of the game is to clear an abstract minefield without
		detonating a mine. The game has been written for many system platforms
		in use today, including the Minesweeper for the Windows platform,
		which has come bundled with versions of the operating system from 3.1
		and on. Contrary to the beliefs of some, Minesweeper cannot always be
		solved with 100% certainty, and may require the occasional use of
		probability to flag the square most likely to have a mine. In other
		words, one must sometimes guess to solve a minesweeper puzzle.
